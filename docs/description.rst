This plugin works by adding extra content to the HTML report generated by **pytest-html** and **allure**.

The extra HTML contents that can be added are:

* Screenshot.

* Comment of the screenshot.

* Source of the webpage where the screenshot was taken.

The plugin doesn't take screenshots automatically. Explicit calls need to be make to the plugin API.

**pytest-webtest-extras** integrates with:

* `Selenium <https://www.selenium.dev/>`_

* `Playwright <https://playwright.dev/python/>`_

* `Allure Report <https://allurereport.org/>`_

Theoretically the plugin can also integrate with other Python webtest tools by means of a generic method to add the extra content in the report.

Docstring of tests are also included in the report, as mean to provide a long description of tests.
Therefore, you are highly encouraged to document your tests with docstrings.
